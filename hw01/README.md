This is a basic etch-a-sketch program written in python. It utilizes the curses argparse libraries. 

## Usage

Run the game with `python3 etch-a-sketch.py`. The default board size is 8X8. You may supply your own size with a command of the form: `python3 etch-a-sketch.py -x 19 -y 19`.



## Gameplay
use the arrow keys to move the cursor around the board. Each time you move an 'X' will be drawn on the board in your new location. Press 'c' at anytime to reset the board. Note: your cursor will stay in the same location upon reset. Press 'q' at any time to quite the game.

Thanks for playing!
